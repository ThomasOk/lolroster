							The idea is to create hypothetical matchups between professional
							League of Legends players, and you get to vote for the best team!
						</p>
						<p>
							Each team is randomly generated from a selection of pro players.
							Currently, only players from the European League (LEC) are
							included.
						</p>
						<p>
							For now, since the daily automatic team generation is still a work
							in progress, you can generate new teams manually.
						</p>
					</section>

					<section className="mt-4">
						<h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">üîú What's coming next?</h3>
						<p>
							Right now, the app is an interactive prototype, meaning that your
							votes and interactions are temporary and will reset when you
							refresh the page. Upcoming updates will introduce features such as
							daily automatic matchup generation, saving votes, matchups history
							and possibly a comment section.
